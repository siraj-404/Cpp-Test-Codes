# Hypot Program

## Description
The Hypot Program calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides using the Pythagorean theorem.

## Features
- Input the lengths of the two sides of a right-angled triangle.
- Calculate the hypotenuse.
- Display the result.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hypot.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd hypot
    ```
3. Compile the program:
    ```sh
    g++ -o hypot main.cpp
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the program:
    ```sh
    ./hypot
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the lengths of the two sides.

## Example
```sh
Enter the length of the first side: 3
Enter the length of the second side: 4
The length of the hypotenuse is: 5
```
